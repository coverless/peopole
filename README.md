# peopole: The People Power Ranker

#### Team: Coverless Software

Curtis Matthias - Lead Designer / Senior Developer

Sebastian Craig - Lead Developer / Software Architect


#### Elevator Pitch:

peopole is a brand new way to visualize the news. Typically the average news reader will be presented with news stories which could be about anything, but when looking for current events on peopole the reader will be presented with the most talked about people in the news. By ranking the most talked about people peopole provides the reader with who is important and why they are currently in the spotlight.


#### Details:

The top 100 people are ranked in decending order based on how many times they have been featured in a news article in the past 24 hours.

When clicking on any of the people ranked, peopole provides the user with the top news article about that person.

Every day when a new list of people is generated the user will see thier ranking compared to yesterdays ranking providing a "power ranking" feel.


#### Implementation:

Site is currently hosted at [coverless.github.io](http://coverless.github.io/)
